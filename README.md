# flo-ts-graph

Minimal workflow graph toolkit for TypeScript with zero external deps.

Algorithms:
- Tarjan SCC + condensation DAG for cycle detection
- Kahn topological order for execution planning
- DFS edge classification with cycle extraction
- BFS reachability utilities (shortest/all paths)

Purpose-built for workflow orchestration primitives.
